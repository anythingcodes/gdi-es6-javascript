## Details for Instructors

### Compiling Slides and Running Locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v6 or higher)
2. Run `npm install` from this repository's directory
3. Run `gem install sass` to install Sass. Note: You will need to [download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) to run this `gem` command.
4. Run `grunt` from this repository's directory to compile files. A window will open with the slides running locally. Any changes will automatically refresh.

Make CSS changes to the source files, **not** the compiled CSS files (i.e. **not** those in `/dist`). Source files can be found in `/src/css` as `.scss` files.
